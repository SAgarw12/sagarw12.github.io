This short document briefly describes how to run the code written and
shared by Dr. Benjamin Cohen-Stead. It is available as a package
SmoQyDQMC.

# Installation {#installation .unnumbered}

The following is based only for Julia language. For more details, please
refer to the full documentation\[\]. Open terminal in your device and
open Julia, by typing in Julia (assuming it is already installed). Enter
\] to go to package management interface and type- add SmoQyDQMC to
install the package.

# Execution {#execution .unnumbered}

SmoQyDQMC.jl supports on-sit Hubbard interaction and generalised
electron-phonon interactions. For now, I am referring to the example
code written by Ben and modifying it to accomodate desired lattice,
orbital and type of lattice interaction. The example file is designed to
take input directly from the terminal.
