# Backflow Transformations via Neural Networks for Quantum Many-Body Wave Functions
I came across this paper during a seminar where the speaker used "Backflow Transformations" to model different systems and used the Hubbard model as the benchmark. Solving the Hubbard model in itself has been proven to be quite tricky and challenging throughout the decades. Therefore, using it for benchmarking says something about the method the authors are trying to develop(or have developed) here. As a student naive to the workings of deep learning and neural networks, it intrigues me and sounds promising to me.
