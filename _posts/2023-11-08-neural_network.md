## Backflow Transformations via Neural Networks for Quantum Many-Body Wave Functions
### <span style="color: grey;">Source: Above reference article</span> 
I came across a paper during a seminar where the speaker/author used "Backflow Transformations" to model different systems and used the Hubbard model as the benchmark. Solving the Hubbard model in itself has been proven to be quite tricky and challenging throughout the decades. Therefore, using it for benchmarking says something about the method the authors are trying to develop(or have developed) here. As a student naive to the workings of deep learning and neural networks, it intrigues me and sounds promising to solve interacting problems in general in physics. With this inspiration, I would mark this as a starting point in the journey to explore the speaker's method and then investigate it on my own given it would still sound interesting. This is not required to be a linear approach, and thus, the broad objective of the journey could be updated from time to time.

## Objective (for ref. article):
Drawing a rough picture(first draft) of the method (NNB) proposed in the article.

### Possible ways to further the study
* Approach the authors with the doubts to get clearer understanding
