\title{On running the code}
\author{Shruti Agarwal}

\maketitle
This short document briefly describes how to run the code written
and shared by Dr. Benjamin Cohen-Stead. It is available as a package
SmoQyDQMC. 

\section*{Installation}

The following is based only for Julia language. For more details,
please refer to the full documentation{[}{]}. Open terminal in your
device and open Julia, by typing in Julia (assuming it is already
installed). Enter {]} to go to package management interface and type-
add SmoQyDQMC to install the package.

\section*{Execution}

SmoQyDQMC.jl supports on-sit Hubbard interaction and generalised electron-phonon
interactions. For now, I am referring to the example code written
by Ben and modifying it to accomodate desired lattice, orbital and
type of lattice interaction. The example file is designed to take
input directly from the terminal.
